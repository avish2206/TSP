This repository contains solutions to the Travelling Salesman Problem in MATLAB, Python and Java.
The problem is a graph traversal problem; a person must start at a note, visit all nodes exactly once, and then return to the starting node, while minimizing total cost (distance). The problem is NP-Complete, meaning there is no polynomial time solution. The methods used in this repo include brute force and dynamic programming.
