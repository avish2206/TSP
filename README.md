This repository contains solutions to the Travelling Salesman Problem in Java, MATLAB and Python.
The problem is a graph traversal problem; a person must start at a note, visit all nodes exactly once, and then return to the starting node, while minimizing total cost (distance). The problem is NP-hard, meaning there is no polynomial time solution.
